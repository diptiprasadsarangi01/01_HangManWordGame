# Hangman Game
- Hangman is a popular guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and other players try to guess it by suggesting letters. 
- Each incorrect guess adds a part to a stick figure drawn on a gallows. 
- The game is over when the stick figure is complete, or if the word is guessed before then.
